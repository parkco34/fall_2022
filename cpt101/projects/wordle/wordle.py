"""
Computer picks a 5-letter word and keeps it hidden.
User guesses a 5-letter word and is informed:
    - Letters in the word and their positions
    - Letters in the word, but in the wrong positions
    - Letters not in the word at all
- All guesses must be valid words
- User gets 6 guesses , after which the correct word will be displayed

GREEN - Correct letter in correct position
ORANGE - Correct letter in incorrect position
BLACK - Incorrect letter in incorrect position
------------------------------------------------------
PLAN:
    - Read file of words: word_list.txt and determine difficulty
    - Computer selects the word
    - User guesses w/ conditions
    - Identify GOOD letters in CORRECT/INCORRECT position
        - If any of the letters are in the guess and in correct position,
        highlight GREEN
        - Elif any of the letters are in the guess but in the incorect
        position, highlight YELLOW
        - else, since none of the letters are in the guess, highlight nothing
        and get another guess...
    - If guess is INVALID, it doesn't count and the user can guess again

    - Display BOARD as a grid of
